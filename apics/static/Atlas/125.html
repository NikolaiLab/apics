<body><p class="c10">The palato-alevolar
(“hushing”) sibilants [ʃ] and [ʒ] are much less common in the
world’s languages than the (dental or) alveolar sibilants [s] and
[z], so it is not surprising that there is interesting variation in
their occurrence across <i>APiCS</i>. Here we consider both [ʃ] and
[ʒ] and ask to what extent they occur in our languages.</p><p>value-table</p><p class="c10">The 17 languages where
both [ʃ] and [ʒ] exist as major allophones are almost all languages
with a European (English, Portuguese or French) lexifier.</p><p class="c10">In another 20
languages, both [ʃ] and [ʒ] exist, but at least one of them is
either a minor allophone or occurs only in loanwords. For example,
in <a href="/contributions/37">Principense</a> [ʃ] and [s] do not contrast, but [ʃ] is an allophone
of /s/ that occurs before [i]. In <a href="/contributions/46">Zamboanga Chabacano</a>, [ʃ] occurs
in words such as <i>informasyón</i> (alternating with [sj]). In
<a href="/contributions/60">Lingala</a>, [ʃ] occurs only in loanwords and placenames such as
<i>Kinshása</i>. In <a href="/contributions/23">Bislama</a>, the pronunciation of [ʃ] in words such
as [ʃus] ‘shoes’ “indexes higher education, or greater exposure to
English or French” <a href="/contributions/23">(Meyerhoff 2013)</a>.</p><p class="c10">There are 25 languages
where only [ʃ] exists (as a major or minor allophone or only in
loanwords), but the converse language type, with only a [ʒ] sound
and no [ʃ], is not attested. This is in line with the general
tendency for fricatives to be voiceless. Examples of such languages
are <a href="/contributions/23">Bislama</a>, <a href="/contributions/13">Gullah</a>, <a href="/contributions/40">Korlai</a> and <a href="/contributions/57">Tayo</a>.</p><p class="c10">Finally, 14 languages
lack [ʃ] and [ʒ] entirely. This type is found particularly among
the Asian and Pacific languages, as well as in the Indian Ocean and
only in a few Caribbean languages. In French-based languages such
as <a href="/contributions/56">Seychelles Creole</a>, French [ʃ] and [ʒ] are reflected by [s] and
[z]:</p>

notes that [ʃ] and [ʒ] are lacking in many West African languages,
so he regards substrate influence on the Atlantic creoles as quite
likely. In the Indian Ocean, Malagasy influence may play a
role.</p>
