English</span> <span class="c11">thick</span> <span class="c10">and</span> <span class="c11">this</span><span class="c10">, respectively) are commonly called interdental fricatives,
though <a class="ref-link" data-content="maddieson2005c" style="cursor: pointer;">Maddieson (2005c</a>: 83) calls them dental nonsibilant
fricatives. They represent a less loud and lower-pitched sound than
the sibilants [s] and [z]. In <a class="ref-link" data-content="maddieson2005c" style="cursor: pointer;">Maddieson’s (2005c)</a> world-wide
sample, they occur only in about 8% of the languages, so they are
quite uncommon. But they are found sporadically on all
continents.</span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c10">Among the languages of</span>

languages:</span></p><p>value-table</p><p class="c12">11 of these languages
are English-based, and they inherited their <span class="c10">[θ] and [ð] sounds from English. But the
majority of English-based languages have replaced these sounds by
[t] and [d], respectively. This can be seen easily for the

            <p class="c12"><span class="c10">[θ] and [ð] are major allophones in
<a href="/contributions/14">African American English</a> and in <a href="/contributions/24">Norf’k</a>. They are found as minor
allophones in Bahamian, Belizean and Nicaraguan Creole (three less
basilectal Caribbean English Creole varieties). In addition, they
are found in the Asian varieties <a href="/contributions/21">Singlish</a> and <a href="/contributions/20">Chinese Pidgin English</a>. In other English-based varieties, they are only found in
loanwords, or only [θ] or only [ð] are found.</span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c10">The most striking case of a
non-English-based variety with [θ] and [ð] is Portuguese-based
<a href="/contributions/36">Angolar</a> in the Gulf of Guinea, where the former [s] and [z] sounds
turned into [θ] and [ð] (except in front of [i]). For some
